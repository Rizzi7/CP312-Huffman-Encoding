of the world. rumor grew of a shadow in
the east ... whispers of a nameless
fear. and the ring of power perceived
... its time had now come. it abandoned

suddenly a voice screams ... its anguish ringing through the
cold, dank tunnels...

 tale by bilbo baggins.

bilbo has dictated. he turns the next page, which is blank.

 bilbo

close on bilbo dips his pen in the ink, and begins writing.
 bilbo
 concerning hobbits.
ext. hobbiton  day

settlement nestled amongst rolling green hills and large trees.
the hobbits live in hobbit holes neat burrows dug into the
grassy hillside, with round doors and cute front gardens.
montage of shots under bilbo hobbits plowing fields ...smoking
pipes ... serving food ... woodworking ... leading pigs ...
milking cattle ... tidying their porches ... and of course,
sleeping.
 continued 
9.
continued
 bilbo v.o.
 hobbits have been living and farming in
 the four farthings of the shire for many
 hundreds of years, quite content to
 ignore and be ignored by the world of
 the big folk. middleearth being, after
 all, full of strange creatures beyond
 count, hobbits must seem of little
 importance being neither renowned as
 great warriors nor counted among the
 very wise.

int. bag end study  day
angle on bilbo laughs. he turns to a knock at the door.

ext. hobbiton  day

from his sweetheart and a muffin, chooses the muffin.
 bilbo v.o.
 in fact, it has been remarked by
 some that hobbits only real passion
 is for food.
image a hobbit carries a barrel of ale on his shoulder,
refilling his mug as he walks.
 bilbo v.o.
 a rather unfair observation as we
 have also developed a keen interest
 in the brewing of ales...
image several hobbits sit around smoking pipes.
 bilbo v.o.
 ...and the smoking of pipeweed.

image hobbits carry their fresh picked crops ... hobbits
engaged in a leisurely game ... hobbits gardening.
 bilbo v.o.
 but where our hearts truly lie is
 in peace and quiet and good, tilled
 earth.
image samwise gamgee sits in front of his house, admiring
his flowers.
 bilbo v.o.
 for all hobbits share a love of
 things that grow.
image near a large, old tree, hobbits raise banners and tents.
others bring in barrels of ale.
 bilbo v.o.
 and, yes, no doubt to others, our
 ways seem quaint. but today of all
 days, it is brought home to me it
 is no bad thing to celebrate a
 simple life.
image the hobbits raise a large banner that reads happy
birthday bilbo baggins. others applaud.

an old tree. white flowers are scattered among the well seeded
grasses. an idyllic setting at the end of a long hot summer ...
the figure is reading a book.
on the soundtrack in the distance, growing louder ... over the
gentle clip clop of an approaching cart and horse can be heard
the humming of a deep voice to the tune of the road goes ever
on and on...
suddenly the figure in the grass sits up ... looking straight
at camera is a handsome young hobbit, with dark curly hair and
deep blue eyes. this is frodo baggins ... his eyes alight with
excitement tossing away the long stem of grass in his mouth,
frodo runs off.

the cart rattles along a leafy lane, driven by a stooped figure
in grey.
intercut with shots of frodo running ... careening down a hill
... jumping over logs ... dodging tree branches.
angle on the shambling old pony snorts and rears as ...
suddenly frodo appears on the bank above the cart.
 frodo
 youre late.
close on gandalf glowers at the young hobbit...
 gandalf
a wizard is never late, frodo baggins,
nor is he early. he arrives precisely
when he means to.
they look at each other for a moment ... then both start
laughing as frodos face breaks into a smile and he leaps on to
the front seat of the cart.
 frodo
 its wonderful to see you, gandalf

wide on the cart rattles over a stone bridge towards a busy
hobbit marketplace.
 bilbo v.o.
 and so life in the shire goes on very
 much as it has this past age full of
 its own comings and goings, with change
 coming slowly...
angle on hobbits look up in wonder and excitement as the cart
bearing gandalf and frodo rolls past the green dragon inn...
 bilbo v.o.
 ...if it comes at all. for things are
 made to endure in the shire passing
 from one generation to the next.

hills and large trees.

close on bilbo picks up a map of middle earth.
 frodo v.o.
 he spends hours poring over old maps

pants pockets. suddenly, he looks worried. he pulls his pockets
inside.
 bilbo
 worried
 wheres it gone
quick cuts bilbo desperately searches for something...under
cushions ... in pockets ... through coats ...
angle on he shoves his hands into his vest pockets, and stops
... relieved...

with it.
 gandalf
good gracious, me.
 continued 
15.

 frodo
before you came along, we bagginses
were very well thought of.
 gandalf
indeed
 frodo
never had any adventures or did
anything unexpected.
 gandalf
if youre referring to the incident
with the dragon ... i was barely
involved ...all i did was give your
uncle a little nudge out the door.
 frodo
whatever you did ... youve been
officially labeled a disturber of the
peace.

suspicious.

joke.

front door set into a grassy hillside. there is a sign on the
gate which reads no admittance except on party business.
gandalf strides up the garden path of bag end. he raises his
staff and raps on the front door ... a voice calls out
 bilbo o.s.
 no thank you we dont want any more
 visitors, wellwishers, or distant
 relations.
 gandalf
 and what about very old friends
suddenly the door opens and bilbo baggins stands before him. he
